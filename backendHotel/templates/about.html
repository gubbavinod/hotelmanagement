            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>
                Founded in 2023, Amigos Restaurant is the result of a passion for food and a dream shared by a group of friends.
                We started with a vision to explore the world of culinary delights and bring exceptional dining experiences to our community.
                Our journey is fueled by a commitment to quality, creativity, and a genuine care for the people we serve.
                The name "Amigos Restaurant" reflects our belief in creating a warm and friendly atmosphere, where every customer is treated like a friend.
                "Amigos" means friends in Spanish, and we chose this name to emphasize the welcoming and inclusive nature of our establishment.

                Specializing in a fusion of Indian and international cuisines, our culinary journey began in the vibrant and diverse food culture of India.
                Over the years, our commitment to delivering delightful flavors and memorable dining experiences has led us to expand our presence globally.
                We are proud to have brought the essence of Amigos Restaurant to the United States, sharing our love for exceptional food and warm hospitality
                with an even wider community. Our menu reflects the richness of Indian traditions while embracing the diversity of global culinary influences.

                As we continue to grow, our dedication to quality, creativity, and genuine care remains at the heart of Amigos Restaurant.
                Join us on this gastronomic adventure, where every dish tells a story, and every customer is a cherished friend.
